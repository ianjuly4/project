                    Well Hello There! I'm Max. I work hard and cuddle even harder. Some would call me a workaholic, but is it work when I'm having fun? I have a beautiful and playful exterior, but that is to mask my atheltic, agile, and durable build. I might be a tad bit shy around strangers, but I love playing with my friends.
